# Parametric shim to fix bearing sink for Y-axis into part #1116

When assembling part #1116, the 8mm bearings sink too far down into part #1116.  This is probably because the wood flexes.

This causes the axis with the zip tie to be unable to clear #1116 when sliding towards the front.  

Putting these in adds offset to work around this.  0.100 inches worked for me, but you may have to adjust the thickness depending on your situation.

Print 2 of these, one for the top and bottom smooth rods.  The thickness needs to be the same for both.  Strap the tie straps through the holes.  

I printed initially with ABS, but PLA was stiffer and worked better.
