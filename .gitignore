# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore vim swap files.
*.swp

# For now, ignore X3G binary CAM files for 3D printer.  I don't want machine
# specific binary turds laying all over the place.
*.x3g

# OSX crap
.DS_Store
._.DS_Store

# CorelDraw backup files
Backup_of_*.cdr
